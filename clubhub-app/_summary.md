ClubHub’s Events Module Prototype is a lightweight Flask-based application designed to streamline club event management by enabling easy event creation, attendee sign-ups, and real-time roster tracking. The system features a simple HTML UI and a minimal backend architecture, with RESTful endpoints for integration and future expansion, focusing on iterative development toward advanced club tools such as member roles and dues management. SQLite handles data persistence, and developer-oriented commands facilitate demo data generation and quick startup, making it ideal for small organizations seeking a customizable events platform. The project structure supports flexible extension, with clear separation of models, views, and templates for maintainable growth.
